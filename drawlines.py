Code to draw lines between vertices of STL faces
 - Pass in the numpy array of vertices in form [x y z h]
 - Each row represents a point and every 3 rows represents a connected object face
 - Clip lines using a line clipping algorithm (50px within the passed display screen resolution)
 - Draws lines using a version of the Bresenham's Line Algorithm between every face point
